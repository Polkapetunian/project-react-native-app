# What to wear - A Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is a simple React Native App that uses the accelerometer of the phone to trigger the display of a random outfit from an array. 

## The problem

We got some starting code for this project and the problem was mainly to choose what you wanted to display and when. The objective was to try React Native and Style Components for the first time. I struggled with this since my Chromebook wasn't really up to the task. It froze from time to time. I also had a problem with the app constantly displaying new outfits as I shook the phone. Team mate Katharina helped me solve the problem by comparing to another project that worked better. If I had more time I would have made it so the question and answer doesnt show at the same time.
